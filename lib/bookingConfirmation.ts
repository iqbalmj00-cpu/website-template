/**
 * bookingConfirmation.ts — handover of the confirmation payload from the
 * wizard to /booking-confirmed.
 *
 * It used to travel in the query string: `?name=…&address=…`. The site loads
 * Google Analytics with `gtag('config', …)`, whose page_view carries
 * `page_location` — the whole URL, query string included — so every customer
 * name and service address the wizard redirected with was written into the
 * operator's GA property. sessionStorage is per-tab, never leaves the browser,
 * and survives the reload the customer is most likely to perform.
 *
 * The widget has no equivalent problem: it hands the same fields to its own
 * confirmation view in memory (see booking-widget/src/components/Widget.tsx).
